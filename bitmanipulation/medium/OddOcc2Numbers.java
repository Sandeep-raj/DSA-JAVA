/*
 * Two Numbers With Odd Occurrences
 * 
 * Problem statement
You are given an array 'arr' of size 'n'.
It contains an even number of occurrences for all numbers except two numbers.
Find those two numbers which have odd occurrences and return in decreasing order.

Example:
For 'arr' = {2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 4} , 'n' = 6.
Answer is {3, 1}.
Here, numbers 1, 3 have occurrence 1 i.e. odd and numbers 2, 4 have occurrence 2 i.e. even.


Sample Input 1:
4
3 3 1 2 
Sample Output 1:
2 1
Explanation of sample output 1:
'n' = 4, ‘arr’ = {3, 3, 1, 2}
Answer is {2, 1}
Here, numbers 1, 2 have occurrence 1 i.e. odd and number 3 have occurrence 2 i.e. even.
Sample Input 2:
2
1 2
Sample Output 2:
2 1
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
Time Limit: 1 sec
Expected space complexity:
Can you solve this in O(1) space complexity?
