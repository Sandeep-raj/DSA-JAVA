/*
 * Problem Statement: Find the gcd of two numbers.

Examples
Example 1:
Input:
 num1 = 4, num2 = 8
Output:
 4
Explanation:
 Since 4 is the greatest number which divides both num1 and num2.

Example 2:
Input:
 num1 = 3, num2 = 6
Output:
 3
Explanation:
 Since 3 is the greatest number which divides both num1 and num2.



Using Euclideanâ€™s theorem.
Intuition: Gcd is the greatest number which is divided by both a and b.If a number is divided by both a and b, it is should be divided by (a-b) and b as well.

Approach:
Recursively call gcd(b,a%b) function till the base condition is hit.
b==0 is the base condition.When base condition is hit return a,as gcd(a,0) is equal to a.
