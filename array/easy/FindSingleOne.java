/*
 * Given a non-empty array of integers arr, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format:
 arr[] = {2,2,1}
Result:
 1
Explanation:
 In this array, only the element 1 appear once and so it is the answer.

Example 2:
Input Format:
 arr[] = {4,1,2,1,2}
Result:
 4
Explanation:
 In this array, only element 4 appear once and the other elements appear twice. So, 4 is the answer.



 Optimal Approach(Using XOR): 
Intuition:
Two important properties of XOR are the following:

XOR of two same numbers is always 0 i.e. a ^ a = 0. ←Property 1.
XOR of a number with 0 will result in the number itself i.e. 0 ^ a = a.  ←Property 2

Here all the numbers except the single number appear twice and so will form a pair. Now, if we perform XOR of all elements of the array, the XOR of each pair will result in 0 according to the XOR property 1. The result will be = 0 ^ (single number) = single number (according to property 2).

So, if we perform the XOR of all the numbers of the array elements, we will be left with a single number.

Approach:
We will just perform the XOR of all elements of the array using a loop and the final XOR will be the answer.
Dry run:

Assume the given array is: [4,1,2,1,2]
XOR of all elements = 4^1^2^1^2
      = 4 ^ (1^1) ^ (2^2)
      = 4 ^ 0 ^ 0 = 4^0 = 4
Hence, 4 is the single element in the array.
