/*
 * You are given an array of integers, your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the end of the array and move non-negative integers to the front by maintaining their order.

Examples
Example 1:
Input:
 1 ,0 ,2 ,3 ,0 ,4 ,0 ,1
Output:
 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0
Explanation:
 All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order

Example 2:
Input:
 1,2,0,1,0,4,0
Output:
 1,2,1,4,0,0,0
Explanation:
 All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order



 Algorithm / Intuition
 We can optimize the approach using 2 pointers i.e. i and j. The pointer j will point to the first 0 in the array and i will point to the next index.

Assume, the given array is {1, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 4, 5, 1}. Now, initially, we will place the 2-pointers like the following:


The algorithm will be the following.

Algorithm:
First, using a loop, we will place the pointer j. If we donâ€™t find any 0, we will not perform the following steps.
After that, we will point i to index j+1 and start moving the pointer using a loop.
While moving the pointer i, we will do the following:
If a[i] != 0 i.e. a[i] is a non-zero element: We will swap a[i] and a[j]. Now, the current j is pointing to the non-zero element a[i]. So, we will shift the pointer j by 1 so that it can again point to the first zero.
Finally, our array will be set in the right manner.

                arr[i] = arr[j];
                arr[j] = temp;
