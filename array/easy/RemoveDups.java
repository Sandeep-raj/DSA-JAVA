/*
 * Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

If there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of the array should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Note: Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of the array.

Examples
Example 1:
Input:
 arr[1,1,2,2,2,3,3]

Output:
 arr[1,2,3,_,_,_,_]

Explanation:
 Total number of unique elements are 3, i.e[1,2,3] and Therefore return 3 after assigning [1,2,3] in the beginning of the array.

Example 2:
Input:
 arr[1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4]

Output:
 arr[1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_,_,_]

Explanation:
 Total number of unique elements are 4, i.e[1,2,3,4] and Therefore return 4 after assigning [1,2,3,4] in the beginning of the array.


Algorithm / Intuition
Two pointers
Intuition: We can think of using two pointers ‘i’ and ‘j’, we move ‘j’ till we don't get a number arr[j] which is different from arr[i]. As we got a unique number we will increase the i pointer and update its value by arr[j]. 

Approach:
Take a variable i as 0;
Use a for loop by using a variable ‘j’ from 1 to length of the array.
If arr[j] != arr[i], increase ‘i’ and update arr[i] == arr[j].
After completion of the loop return i+1, i.e size of the array of unique elements.
